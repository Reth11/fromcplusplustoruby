by Kyle Tuffentsamer

1. Write a program for the following problem. You are given a file that contains
a collection of scores (type int) for the last exam in your computer corse. You 
are to computer the average of these scores and assign grades to each student 
according to the following rule: 
  If a student's score is within 10 points (above or below) of the average, assign 
  the grade of satisfactory. If a student's score is more than 10 points above 
  average, assign a grade of oustanding. If a student's score is more than 10 points 
  below average, assign a grade of unsatisfactory.
  
  The output from your program should consist of a labeled two-column list that shows 
  each score and its corresponding grade. As part of the solution your program should 
  include functions that correspond to the function prototypes that follow.
  
  a)Reads exam scores into array scores
  b)Computes average of count student scores
  c)Pritns a table showing each student's score and grade on a seperate line
